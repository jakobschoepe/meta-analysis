## **Quick Tour**
The following code chunk shows all commands required for fitting a fixed-effect and/or random-effects model. Please note that this example illustrates effect estimation and model fitting for a categorical outcome measure (here odds ratio). However, the same functions allow effect estimation and model fitting for a continuous outcome measure (e.g. mean difference).

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Install the metafor package
install.packages(pkgs = "metafor")

# Load the metafor package
library(package = "metafor")

# Set the working directory
setwd(dir = "/myUserName/myFilePath/")

# Read a CSV-file into the global R environment
DF <- read.csv2(file = "myData.csv"); DF

# Optional: Estimate the effect measure for all included studies
DF <- escalc(measure = "OR", ai = ai, bi = bi, ci = ci, di = di, data = DF); DF

# Fit a fixed effect model
fe.fit <- rma(yi = yi, vi = vi, measure = "OR", data = DF, slab = Study, method = "FE")

# Extract model parameters from the estimated fixed effect model
summary(object = fe.fit)

# Create a forest plot from the estimated fixed effect model
forest(x = fe.fit, showweights = TRUE, atransf = exp)

# Fit a random effects model
re.fit <- rma(yi = yi, vi = vi, measure = "OR", data = DF, slab = Study, method = "REML", test = "knha")

# Extract model parameters from the estimated random effects model
summary(object = re.fit)

# Create a forest plot from the estimated random effects model
forest(x = re.fit, showweights = TRUE, atransf = exp)
```
